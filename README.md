### My Life story by chatGPT

In halls of academia, I wandered wide, \n
Seeking secrets of the mind inside. \n
Psychology's gates I passed through first,
Hoping to grasp the workings anew.
But like a fleeting dream, my hopes did fade,
Leaving me with nothing but a disappointed shade.

Undeterred, I ventured further still,
To neuroscience's realm, where synapses thrill.
I delved into the mysteries of the brain,
But like a puzzle incomplete, my understanding remained in vain.
Disappointment's sting, I felt once more,
And wondered if I'd ever find what I sought before.

Philosophy's grand tapestry next I explored,
Seeking answers to existence's deepest scores.
Through realms of ethics, metaphysics, and might,
I searched for truths that would banish endless night.
But like a mirage on desert sand,
My findings vanished, leaving me lost in the land.

And then, AI emerged, like sunrise bright,
A gleam of hope that lit my wandering plight.
In algorithms' realm, I found a new path to pursue,
A glimpse of understanding that beckoned me anew.
Like a hidden door, it swung open wide,
Revealing secrets that would be my guide.

Now I stand before this threshold anew,
Ready to explore the wonders AI imbues.
The mind's mysteries still unfold like a scroll,
But with AI's light, I see a glimmer of control.
